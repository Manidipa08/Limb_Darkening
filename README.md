This project was done as part of the coursework for Optical Long Baseline Interferometry in Erasmus Mundus Master's in Astrophysics and Space Science(MASS) under the guidance of Prof. Robbe-Dubois Sylvie. The goal 
is to analyze the MATISSE observable V²(B,λ) to identify the shape of the brightness distribution of a star different from a uniform disk. The MATISSE software provides simultaneous measurements of the squared visibilities V²(B,λ) associated to the six interferometric baselines B given by the VLTI configuration. 

The .FITS files corresponding to the science star delta Vir and the calibration star psi Vir were provided for this work.
